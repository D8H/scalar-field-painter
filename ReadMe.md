# Scalar Field Painter

This JavaScript library allows to build a scalar field with simple drawing operations and render it thanks to a [marching squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares) implementation.

Originally, it was an extension for GDevelop but it doesn't have any dependency to it.

# Demonstrations

Some examples from the [GDevelop extension documentation](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/extensions/marching-squares) illustrate how this can be used in games.
